# School Site Redesign

1. Fork the repository from Github.
2. Create a new workspace in Cloud 9 (use the repository you forked!).
3. Add new pages for "activities" and "teachers" at your school (and anything else you can think of).
4. Add links to your new pages to the nav bar on the homepage.
5. Include the nav bar in all your new pages.
6. Use jQuery to change the color of each link in the nav bar when you hover over it.
7. Add images to the home page and size them using percentages.
8. If you have time, add more styling, javascript, or other html pages!
9. Commit your changes and push them to github.
